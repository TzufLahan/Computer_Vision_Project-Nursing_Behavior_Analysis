# Heatmap-Based Motion Analysis for Nurse Activity Monitoring  

## Overview  

This project was developed to analyze and visualize nurse movement patterns in an emergency room setting. By processing video footage from patient rooms, the system generates heatmaps that highlight the frequency and intensity of nurse presence around the patient.  

The goal of this project is to gain insights into nurse-patient interactions, assess response times, and identify behavioral patterns that could contribute to improving patient care and hospital workflow efficiency.  

## Purpose and Motivation  

In emergency and critical care settings, understanding how nurses interact with patients is crucial for optimizing medical assistance. This project provides a data-driven approach to monitoring nurse activity by:  

- Identifying high-traffic areas in the patient room.  
- Detecting time spent in critical zones, such as near the patientâ€™s bed or medical equipment.  
- Understanding movement patterns that correlate with specific medical interventions.  
- Improving workflow analysis for better patient care and hospital resource allocation.  

## How It Works  

1. **Video Processing**  
   - Extracts frames from recorded footage of patient rooms.  
   - Uses reference frames to maintain spatial consistency across different recordings.  

2. **Motion Detection**  
   - Applies OpenCV's Background Subtraction (MOG2) to detect motion within the scene.  
   - Identifies and isolates movement patterns related to nurse activity.  

3. **Heatmap Generation**  
   - Aggregates detected motion across all frames.  
   - Applies a color-mapped overlay to highlight areas with the highest nurse activity.  
   - Superimposes the heatmap on the original video frame for easy visualization.  

## Heatmap Example  

The following image shows an example of a generated heatmap overlaid on a patient room. Areas with high activity are shown in warmer colors (yellow/red), while low-activity areas remain cooler (blue).

## Insights and Applications  

This analysis can provide valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of nurse-patient interactions:  

- **Patient Safety**: Ensuring that nurses spend adequate time attending to critical patients.  
- **Workflow Optimization**: Identifying inefficient movement patterns to enhance hospital procedures.  
- **Resource Allocation**: Determining whether medical staff are distributed efficiently in emergency situations.  
- **Training and Evaluation**: Providing data-driven feedback to improve nurse response times and overall patient care.
